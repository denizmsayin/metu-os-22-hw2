### Extra Info About Restrictions

* Both System V and POSIX semaphores are allowed: Feel free to use <semaphore.h> or <sys/sem.h>.

### Reading Material

* Read the PDF!
* See `complex_scenarios.pdf` to learn how your code should deal with some cases. It is empty for
  now, but will be filled as you ask about scenarios or as I want to explain them.

### Usage

Use `git clone https://github.com/denizmsayin/metu-os-22-hw2` to get the repository on your local
machine. You can then use `git pull` inside the directory to apply any updates.
